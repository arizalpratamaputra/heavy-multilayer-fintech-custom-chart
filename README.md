Custom Chart Engine — Showcase Edition

A clean and self-contained demonstration of a **custom high-performance candlestick chart engine** built on top of `lightweight-charts` with fully manual enhancements:

- ✔️ Synthetic live OHLC generator  
- ✔️ Smooth micro-tick price animation (sinusoidal easing)  
- ✔️ Ghost candles (predictive future bars)  
- ✔️ Custom overlay rendering (canvas grid, labels, last-price line)  
- ✔️ Candlestick flip logic  
- ✔️ Zero backend or global context dependencies  
- ✔️ Lightweight, readable, and production-style code  
- ✔️ Perfect for demonstrating low-level chart-engineering skills

This version is intentionally simplified for **professional code review**, derived from the proprietary chart engine built for fintech company.
